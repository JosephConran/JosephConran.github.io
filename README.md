I understand this will be my portfolio a place for potential customers or jobs to find my resumee and past work. I did a lot of research on others portfolios and really see that theres seems to be very different approaches according to type of website work you do. I ran into a lot of UI/Ux design portfolios and artist or marketing designs and very view software developer or fullstack portfolios. I really wanna understand my direction and work more before I really set in stone my developement of this site. I really want short text with a minimalist feel that kinda instantly draws you to the work. 

- 1. Choose 2 maybe 3 fonts to use through whole page
  2. Choose a very mild color paleete to keep user engaged with content
  3. style projects to show projects clearly while demonstrating unique interactivity in a clean and crisp way
  4. add contact pages and professional level photos to keep things professional and trustworthy
  5. adjust through feedback and training as I learn through the IOD classes
